        <p1>My name is Pakalnah Nii Aflah Sackey. I graduated from St. Peters Senior High<br>
                     School and gained admission into the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of<br>
                     Science and Technology to read Bsc. Computer Engineering.</p1>
        <p class="2">Growing up I have always been fascinated by computers,television,<br>
                     phones and other electrical gadgets.</p>
        <p class="3">I was curious about how they worked and got the opportunity to<br>   
                     find out for myself when I went to work as an apprentice in a<br>
                     phone shop.</p>
        <p class="4">The experience introduced me to the world of technology and <br>
                     left me with a burning hunger to know more.</p>
        <p class="5">I first learnt about the programme through online research and<br>
                     got to know more about the programme through a career fair I attended.<br>
                     The programme aligns with my passions and I believe I can make a <br>
                     significant impact in my community by using the skills I learn to solve <br>
                     problems in the community. </p>
