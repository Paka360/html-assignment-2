        <p class="1">My name is Pakalnah Sackey. I graduated from St. Peters Senior High School and gained admission into the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to read Bsc. Computer Engineering.</p>
        <p class="2">Growing up I have always been fascinated by computers,television,phones and other electrical gadgets.</p>
        <p class="3">I was curious about how they worked and got the opportunity to find out for myself when I went to work as an apprentice in a phone shop.</p>
        <p class="4">The experience introduced me to the world of technology and left me with a burning hunger to know more.</p>
        <p class="5">As I thought of the programme I would read in the University I found at That Computer Engineering was the best course for me. It has a lot of job opportunities and is where my passion lies. </p>
