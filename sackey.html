      <h3 class="bme1"> My name is Pakalnah Nii Aflah Sackey. I graduated from St. Peters Senior High School 
        and gained admmission into the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to read 
        Bsc. Computer Engineering.
        Growing up I was always facinated by computers, television, phones and various other electrical gadgets. 
        I wanted to understand how they worked so right after BECE I went to work as an apprentice in a phone
        shop where I was introduced to the world of technology. The experience opened my mind to the 
        various opportunities in the world of technology. That's when I decided to study Computer engineering.
        We are in the age of technology and I believe a programme like Computer engineering not only promises 
        job security but also a life of fulfillment and  discovery.
